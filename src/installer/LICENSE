License: IBMTTS
 International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs
 .
 Part 1 - General Terms
 .
 BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON OR A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL ENTITY TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS,
 .
 - DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, OR USE THE PROGRAM; AND
 .
 - PROMPTLY RETURN THE PROGRAM AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT TO OBTAIN A REFUND OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID. IF YOU DOWNLOADED THE PROGRAM, CONTACT THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT.
 .
 "IBM" is International Business Machines Corporation or one of its subsidiaries.
 .
 "License Information" ("LI") is a document that provides information specific to a Program. The Program's LI is available at http://www.ibm.com/software/sla/ . The LI may also be found in a file in the Program's directory, by the use of a system command, or as a booklet which accompanies the Program.
 .
 "Program" is the following, including the original and all whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and data, 2) components, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, text, recordings, or pictures), 4) related licensed materials, and 5) license use documents or keys, and documentation.
 .
 A "Proof of Entitlement" ("PoE") is evidence of Your authorization to use a Program at a specified level. That level may be measured, for example, by the number of processors or users. The PoE is also evidence of Your eligibility for  future upgrade prices, if any, and potential special or promotional opportunities. If IBM does not provide You with a PoE, then IBM may accept the original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom You acquired the Program, provided that it specifies the name of the Program and the usage level acquired.
 .
 "You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to a single legal entity.
 .
 This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - Country-unique Terms (if any), License Information, and Proof of Entitlement and is the complete agreement between You and IBM regarding the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications between You and IBM concerning Your use of the Program. The terms of Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify those of Part 1. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and those of the IBM International Passport Advantage Agreement, the terms of the latter agreement prevail.
 .
 1. Entitlement
 .
 License
 .
 The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold.
 .
 IBM grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program when You lawfully acquire it.
 .
 You may 1) use the Program up to the level of use specified in the PoE and 2) make and install copies, including a backup copy, to support such use. The terms of this license apply to each copy You make. You will reproduce all copyright notices and all other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, of the Program.
 .
 If You acquire the Program as a program upgrade, after You install the upgrade You may not use the Program from which You upgraded or transfer it to another party.
 .
 You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either locally or remotely) does so only for Your authorized use and complies with the terms of this Agreement.
 .
 You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except as provided in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse compile, or otherwise translate the Program except as specifically permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.
 .
 IBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement. If IBM does so, You must destroy all copies of the Program and its PoE.
 .
 Money-back Guarantee
 .
 If for any reason You are dissatisfied with the Program and You are the original licensee, You may obtain a refund of the amount You paid for it, if within 30 days of Your invoice date You return the Program and its PoE to the party from whom You obtained it. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact the party from whom You acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the refund.
 .
 Program Transfer
