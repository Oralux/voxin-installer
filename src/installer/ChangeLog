	release 3.3rc4 for Vocalizer Embedded (x86_64, armv7l, armv8) and IBM TTS (x86_64):

	- Compatibility with distributions supplying Speech Dispatcher 0.10.2.
	The Speech Dispatcher voxin output module is either already
	provided by the distribution (starting with speech-dispatcher
	0.10.2) or otherwise will be installed from the tarball
	(voxin-speechd-conf and/or voxin-speechd packages).
	Tested on Arch Linux, Debian sid, openSUSE, Slint... Full list in
	README.

	- Gentoo & Fedora: install to /usr/lib64 for 64 bits architectures.

	- (Vocalizer Embedded) Fix misplaced sound icon in capital mode.
	Complete rework of indexes.

	- (IBM TTS) Fix spelling regressions introduced in version 3.2.
	With punctuation level set to none, the original spelling was
	altered when a punctuation character preceded a capital
	letter.

	- installer:
	After user's authorization, check if the voxin module must be
	added to the speechd.conf files:
	/home/*/.config/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf
	/etc/speech-dispatcher/speechd.conf
	Voxin must be added if there are uncommented AddModule lines in
	speechd.conf and none of them concerns voxin.
	Checked with speech-dispatcher 0.9.1 (Gentoo)

	- uninstall: remove /opt/oralux, /var/opt/oralux

	release 3.3rc3 for Vocalizer Embedded (x86_64, armv7l, armv8) and IBM TTS (x86_64):

	- Installer: fix for ArchLinux.

2020-11-29 Gilles Casse <gcasse@oralux.org>
	release 3.3rc2 for Vocalizer Embedded (x86_64, armv7l, armv8) and IBM TTS (x86_64):

	- Compatibility with Raspberry Pi OS.

	- Add voxin.ini, configuration file
	The user may now define the default value of several parameters:
	capitalization, punctuation, and only for viavoice: dictionaryDir,
	useAbbreviation.
	More details in the README file (in paragraph: "voxin.ini configuration file").

	- Only for Vocalizer Embedded: fix erroneous speed and pitch changes:
	the speed and pitch parameters were erroneously modified when a
	secondary speech-dispatcher client (e.g. spd-say) was called.

	- Installer: before installing a new version of voxin, the
	previously installed version has to be uninstalled.
	More checks are now added: check first that the system enables
	package installation, and if the installation fails, try to
	restore the previous version.

	- Capital mode: emits a brief sound to point out a word with a capital letter, doubled this sound if all caps.
	  This mode can be currently activated through Orca and Speech-Dispatcher (compatible 0.10.1, 0.9.1, 0.9.0).
	- Backport the speech-dispatcher ibmtts module from upstream/master to version 0.10.1 .
	- voxind-nve (x86_64) built on Debian 8 to depend on glibc 2.2.5 instead of glibc 2.27 (logf).

	IBM TTS is still proposed.

	Here are the known current limits of voxin 3.0.
	These limits should be removed in the forthcoming updates.

	- only for x86_64 architecture (not yet x86, arm),

	- no support yet for dictionaries or annotations,
	- cannot automatically switch from one language to another one.

	Can be useful on 64 bits system as an alternative to the ibmtts 32
	bits libraries. Speech-dispatcher conf files added (in say/ directory).

	* voxin-installer.sh, cryptoloop: the single runtime is no more
	encrypted, for an easier install stage.
