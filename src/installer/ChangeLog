2020-11-29 Gilles Casse <gcasse@oralux.org>
	release 3.3rc2 for Vocalizer Embedded (x86_64, armv7l, armv8) and IBM TTS (x86_64):

	- Compatibility with Raspberry Pi OS.

	- Add voxin.ini, configuration file
	The user may now define the default value of several parameters:
	capitalization, punctuation, and only for viavoice: dictionaryDir,
	useAbbreviation.
	More details in the README file (in paragraph: "voxin.ini configuration file").

	- Only for Vocalizer Embedded: fix erroneous speed and pitch changes:
	the speed and pitch parameters were erroneously modified when a
	secondary speech-dispatcher client (e.g. spd-say) was called.

	- Installer: before installing a new version of voxin, the
	previously installed version has to be uninstalled.
	More checks are now added: check first that the system enables
	package installation, and if the installation fails, try to
	restore the previous version.

	  This mode can be currently activated through Orca and Speech-Dispatcher (compatible 0.10.1, 0.9.1, 0.9.0).
	- Backport the speech-dispatcher ibmtts module from upstream/master to version 0.10.1 .
	- voxind-nve (x86_64) built on Debian 8 to depend on glibc 2.2.5 instead of glibc 2.27 (logf).

2019-12-25 Gilles Casse <gcasse@oralux.org>
	release 3.0: New voices, new languages in Voxin based on Vocalizer Embedded (libvoxin 1.4.4).

	IBM TTS is still proposed.

	Here are the known current limits of voxin 3.0.
	These limits should be removed in the forthcoming updates.

	- only for x86_64 architecture (not yet x86, arm),
	- compatible with Speech-Dispatcher (version > 0.7),
	- compatible with a previous installation of voxin (version >= 2.0),
	- only for UTF-8 texts,

	- not yet compatible with Emacspeak,
	- no support yet for dictionaries or annotations,
	- cannot automatically switch from one language to another one.

	Can be useful on 64 bits system as an alternative to the ibmtts 32
	bits libraries. Speech-dispatcher conf files added (in say/ directory).

	* voxin-installer.sh, cryptoloop: the single runtime is no more
	encrypted, for an easier install stage.
